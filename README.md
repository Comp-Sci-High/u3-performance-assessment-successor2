Why did you pick this API topic?
I had picked this API topic because I am quite knowledgeable about my advisry since I'm there everyday. This is to also show appreciation for my advisory and the people within it.
Describe your API and the available data endpoints
My API shows the daily task my advisory does and who are the advisors are. The fun facts, the name of the advisors, and a picture of who they are.
How was your experience building your own API server after using other APIs as a client in Unit 2?
It was quite easy to do after so much practice, I tried to do the extra credit as well to show how confident I was in doing this.
